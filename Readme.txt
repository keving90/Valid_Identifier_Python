The is_valid_identifier.py script checks whether a string would be a valid Python identifier. A valid identifier contains no special characters, and does not begin with a number.

The get_validity.py script practices importing a module and calling help() on it to get more information on the module. The main part of the script is an interactive identifier validator. The user enters a string, and the program checks to see if this string would be a valid identifier. The user can exit by entering a blank line.
